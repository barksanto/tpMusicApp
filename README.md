Engineering Challenge for TalkPush.

Using Firebase (Cloud Firestore) as database.

Consists of 2 pages Home Page and Albums page. Home Page has 3 lists; Top 10 albums of all time, My Top 10 Songs and My New Songs, data is being fed from database. 
Albums Page has 5 albums in prefilled db where we can 'Buy' the album and it will appear on home screen at the bottom of the page on My New Albums list.

There is one media file that is played/paused when we select the play and pause buttons on the album page.

Song time tracked by progress bar at top of the page.

Let me know if you have any questions about functionality or how I was able to create certain functionalities.
